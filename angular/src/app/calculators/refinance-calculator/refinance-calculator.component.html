            How can refinancing lower my monthly mortgage payment?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-muted">
            To lower your monthly payment, look for a refinance option that
            helps you do one or more of the following:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-refinace pl-20">
            <li>
              Lock in a lower interest rate - The higher your interest rate, the
              more you pay for your mortgage, both now and in the future.
              Refinancing to a loan with a lower rate means you could get a
              lower payment as long as you
            </li>
            <li>
              Stop paying for private mortgage insurance (PMI) - If you put less
              than 20% down on your original home loan, chances are you're
              paying for PMI. If your home has increased in value and/or you
              have enough equity, you
            </li>

            <li>
              Get a longer loan term - When you refinance to a longer-term loan,
              you're stretching the amount you owe over a longer period of time.
              While you might pay more in interest overall, your monthly payment
              will decrease.

              If you have enough equity in your home, you may be able to
              refinance to take cash out. Taking cash out means refinancing your
              home with a larger loan amount. Your new loan pays off your
              existing loan, and you get to pocket the difference.
            </p>
            <p class="text-light">
              Many homeowners take cash out to pay off high-interest debt or
              fund home improvements. The cash you get from a cash-out refinance
              is tax free and yours to spend however you choose.
